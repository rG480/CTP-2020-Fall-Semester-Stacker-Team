      Cellar is an easy to use inventory management system allowing you to track your collections and their details, including quantity,
      <br></br>
      the price an item was purchased for, and the price of the item at the time it was added to your collection. Cellar is a great way  to
      <br></br>
      track your items, with its simple, user friendly interface. Users can also browse the  <Link to={{pathname:'/users'}}> collections of other users. </Link>
